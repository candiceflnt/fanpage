<section><h4>Les paroles</h4>
Uh huh, uh huh<br>
Yeah, Rihanna<br>       
Uh huh, uh huh<br>
Good girl gone bad<br>
Uh huh, uh huh<br>
Take three, action<br>
Uh huh, uh huh, Hov<br>
No clouds in my stones<br>
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank<br>
Comin' down at the Dow Jones<br>
When the clouds come, we gone<br>
We Rocafella<br>
We fly higher than weather<br>
In G5s or better<br>
You know me<br>
In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day<br>
Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine<br>
Rihanna, where you at?<br>
You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart<br>
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star<br>
Baby, 'cause in the dark<br>
You can't see shiny cars<br>
And that's when you need me there<br>
With you I'll always share<br>
Because<br>
When the sun shines, we'll shine together<br>
Told you I'll be here forever<br>
Said I'll always be your friend<br>
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end<br>
Now that it's raining more than ever<br>
Know that we'll still have each other<br>
You can stand under my umbrella<br>
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh<br>
These fancy things will never come in between<br>
You're part of my entity, here for infinity<br>
When the world has took its part<br>
When the world has dealt its cards<br>
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart<br>
Because<br>
When the sun shines, we shine together<br>
Told you I'll be here forever<br>
Said I'll always be your friend<br>
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end<br>
Now that it's raining more than ever<br>
Know that we'll still have each other<br>
You can stand under my umbrella<br>
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh<br>
You can run into my arms<br>
It's okay, don't be alarmed<br>
Come into me<br>
(There's no distance in between our love)<br>
So gon' and let the rain pour<br>
I'll be all you need and more<br>
Because<br>
When the sun shines, we shine together<br>
Told you I'll be here forever<br>
Said I'll always be your friend<br>
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end<br>
Now that it's raining more than ever<br>
Know that we'll still have each other<br>
You can stand under my umbrella<br>
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh<br>
It's raining, raining<br>
Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining<br>
Baby, come into me<br>
Come into me<br>
It's raining, raining<br>
Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining<br>
You can always come into me<br>
Come into me<br>
It's pouring rain<br>
It's pouring rain<br>
Come into me<br>
Come into me<br>
It's pouring rain<br>
It's pouring rain<br>
